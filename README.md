# üéµ Orchestrator - WAV Audio Synthesizer built using Rust

A learning project that generates WAV audio files from JSON music notation by synthesizing sine waves and encoding them in PCM format. This is my first Rust application, built to understand how digital audio works at a low level!

## üéØ What This Does

```
JSON Input ‚Üí Parse Notes ‚Üí Calculate Frequencies ‚Üí Generate Sine Waves ‚Üí PCM Encoding ‚Üí WAV File
```

Takes musical notes described in JSON, calculates their frequencies, generates sine waves for each note, converts them to PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) format, and writes everything to a proper WAV file with RIFF headers.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Build & Run

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run with an input JSON file
cargo run --release inputs/octave.json

# Output will be in: output/<filename>.wav
```

### Requirements

- Rust (2021 edition or later)
- Dependencies: `serde`, `serde_json`

## üìù JSON Input Format

Create a JSON file with your musical composition:

```json
{
  "bpm": 130,
  "notes": [
    { "id": 0, "beats": 1.0, "octave": 4, "amplitude": 1 },
    { "id": 2, "beats": 1.0, "octave": 4, "amplitude": 1 }
  ]
}
```

### Note ID Reference

Each note has a unique ID (0-11) representing the 12 semitones in an octave:

```
0  = C
1  = C‚ôØ / D‚ô≠
2  = D
3  = D‚ôØ / E‚ô≠
4  = E
5  = F
6  = F‚ôØ / G‚ô≠
7  = G
8  = G‚ôØ / A‚ô≠
9  = A
10 = A‚ôØ / B‚ô≠
11 = B
```

### Parameters

- **`bpm`** (beats per minute): Tempo of the music
- **`id`**: Note ID from 0-11 (see table above)
- **`beats`**: Duration of the note in beats
- **`octave`**: Which octave (typically 0-8, where 4 is middle octave)
- **`amplitude`**: Volume (0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is maximum)

## üéµ Example Outputs

This repository includes two example WAV files demonstrating the synthesizer's capabilities:

### üéº octave.wav

A simple C major scale demonstration - plays the notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C ascending and then back down. Perfect for understanding basic note sequencing and how the synthesizer handles different pitches.

- **Source**: [View octave.json](https://github.com/sihilelh/orchestrator-rust/blob/main/inputs/octave.json) for technical details (BPM, note timings, amplitudes)

### üêâ test_drive.wav

A simplified interpretation of the opening melody from "Test Drive" - the iconic theme from _How to Train Your Dragon_ that plays during Hiccup's first flight with Toothless. This piece holds special meaning as it represents my first flight with Rust! ü¶Ä

- **Listen**: [Download test_drive.wav](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sihilelh/orchestrator-rust/refs/heads/main/output/test_drive.wav)
- **Source**: [View test_drive.json](https://github.com/sihilelh/orchestrator-rust/blob/main/inputs/test_drive.json) for technical details (BPM, note timings, amplitudes)

**How to play**: Download the WAV files and open them in any audio player (Windows Media Player, VLC, iTunes, QuickTime, etc.)

## üß† Key Concepts & Implementation

### 1. Frequency Calculation (Equal Temperament Tuning)

Western music uses the **A440** standard, where the note A4 (middle A) vibrates at exactly 440 Hz. All other notes are calculated using the **equal temperament** formula:

```
f = 440 √ó 2^((n - 9) / 12)
```

Where:

- `f` = frequency in Hz
- `n` = semitone offset from C4
- `440` = A4 frequency (standard tuning)
- `9` = A is the 9th semitone in the octave (counting from C=0)
- `12` = semitones per octave

**Example**: To find C4 (middle C):

- C is ID 0, which is 9 semitones below A4
- `n = 0 - 9 = -9`
- `f = 440 √ó 2^(-9/12) = 440 √ó 0.5946 ‚âà 261.63 Hz`

For different octaves, we add `12 √ó (octave - 4)` to the semitone count:

```rust
let n = (note_id - 9) + 12 √ó (octave - 4)
let frequency = 440.0 * 2.0_f64.powf(n / 12.0)
```

### 2. Sine Wave Generation

Sound is vibrations, and pure musical tones can be represented as **sine waves**. A sine wave oscillates smoothly between -1 and +1.

![sin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/208d9802-d65d-4e08-adda-78218231e7a8)

The formula to generate a sample at any point in time:

```
sample(t) = amplitude √ó sin(2œÄ √ó frequency √ó t)
```

Where:

- `t` = time in seconds = sample_index / sample_rate
- `2œÄ` = one complete cycle (360 degrees in radians)
- `frequency` = how many cycles per second (Hz)
- `amplitude` = volume (0.0 to 1.0)

**In code**:

```rust
let t = sample_index as f64 / sample_rate as f64;
let sample = amplitude * (2.0 * PI * frequency * t).sin();
```

### 3. PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)

Computers can't store continuous sine waves (-1.0 to +1.0), so we **digitize** them into discrete integer values. This is called **PCM encoding**.

**16-bit PCM** uses signed integers from **-32,767 to +32,767**:

| Sine Wave (float) | PCM (16-bit int) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 1.0               | +32,767          |
| 0.5               | +16,383          |
| 0.0               | 0                |
| -0.5              | -16,384          |
| -1.0              | -32,767          |

**Conversion formula**:

```rust
let pcm_value = (float_sample * 32767.0) as i16;
```

We also **clamp** values to prevent distortion:

```rust
let float_sample = sine_sample.clamp(-1.0, 1.0);
```

### 4. WAV File Format (RIFF/WAV)

A WAV file is a container format following the **RIFF** (Resource Interchange File Format) structure. It consists of **chunks** of data:

![wav_headers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38b9f1d7-422f-42b3-9287-9e75fa8ad4a2)

**Key calculations**:

- `byte_rate` = sample_rate √ó channels √ó (bits_per_sample / 8)
- `block_align` = channels √ó (bits_per_sample / 8)
- `data_size` = number_of_samples √ó (bits_per_sample / 8)
- `file_size` = 36 + data_size

All multi-byte integers are stored in **little-endian** format (least significant byte first).
