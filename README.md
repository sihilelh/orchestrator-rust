## How to input musical notes

Every note have it's own id

```
0 = C
1 = C♯ / D♭
2 = D
3 = D♯ / E♭
4 = E
5 = F
6 = F♯ / G♭
7 = G
8 = G♯ / A♭
9 = A
10 = A♯ / B♭
11 = B
```

For every note we need the note id, how many semi tones that note have, and the octave it's in
So as a example a simple octave play would be like this
